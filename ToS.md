## I. Platform Description and Purpose
The Site is an AI-powered platform designed to help advance the understanding of infectious disease outbreaks for purposes of aiding research analyses, infectious disease surveillance, epidemic modeling, and data visualizations. The platform utilizes generative artificial intelligence and data mining tools to develop and evaluate infectious outbreak scenarios for public health preparedness. The Site contains data and resources from sources from across the world. We do not endorse nor are we responsible for any data or Content available from such sources.

## II. Artificial Intelligence Content Disclaimer
This platform uses artificial intelligence and machine learning models to generate infectious disease outbreak scenarios, predictions, and analyses for research and preparedness purposes. Users acknowledge and agree that:
1. AI-generated content is experimental, predictive, and probabilistic in nature and should not be relied upon as the sole basis for public health decisions, medical treatment, policy formulation, or emergency response actions.
2. AI models may contain inaccuracies, biases, limitations, or errors and may not reflect all relevant factors or the most current information available.
3. AI-generated scenarios are simulations based on available data and modeling assumptions and may not accurately predict actual outbreak patterns, transmission rates, or public health outcomes.
4. Users agree to use AI-generated content only as one factor among many in their research, analysis, or decision-making processes and to validate findings through appropriate scientific methods and expert consultation.
5. We make no warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness for any particular purpose of AI-generated content.

Systematic retrieval of Content from the Site by users, including, without limitation, by using any data mining, crawlers, spiders, robots, or similar automated methods, to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory is strictly prohibited without prior written permission from CAPTRS or Northeastern University in each instance, except as expressly permitted within the Site for personal, public health and/or non-commercial research purposes and subject to these Terms of Use.
